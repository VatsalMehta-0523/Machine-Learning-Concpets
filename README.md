# Machine-Learning-Concpets
Machine learning concepts, workflows, and model implementations

## About this repo

This repository contains my machine learning work, including model implementations,
experiments, and reusable workflows that I apply when solving ML problems.

My focus is on understanding the full machine learning process — from data exploration
and modeling choices to evaluation and reproducibility — rather than treating models
as isolated components.

The notebooks here reflect how I reason about:
- Data and feature behavior
- Model assumptions and trade-offs
- Metric selection based on problem context
- Practical workflows such as preprocessing and pipelines

The work here reflects a process-driven approach to machine learning and
evolves as concepts and implementations improve.
